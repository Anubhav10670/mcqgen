This is an AI based mcq generator.
it uses pdf.js to extract text from your text-based pdfs like ncert pdfs, study materials etc and uses it to call api of trained llms, further it fetches the response , converts it into json if it isnt and parses it to display content in the UI.
it is a normal tool which seems very unique , innovative and productive.

ive coded it with my self knowledge and automated several taks using LLMs , ive quited this project due to lack of free apis and lack of financial motivation behind it and the idea requires too much development and progress which isnt probably something i can do with other things.
i realize it isnt some emotional dumping but a page to tell what does the project do and basically how does it do, but ive just built it never thought much like an entrepreneur and how much i ll progress it.
this project taught me a lot about react , web development , problems which are common in most of the projects and what not ,very  memorable journey.
thanks for reading :D
